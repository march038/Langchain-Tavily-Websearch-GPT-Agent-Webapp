# Search the web wiith Tavily and answer the prompt including the target-URL with a LangChain GPT-agent #
Hi!

This agent searches the with Tavily using the TavilySearchResults tool from Langchain and answers the prompt, including the target-url webadress.
Please note, that a (free) API-key is needed to use Tavily.

As always, I used streamlit to create a prototype webapp for displaying.


The following libraries are needed:

- os (to set up API-keys for OpenAI and Tavily)

- langchain

- streamlit

As always, the code is thoroughly commented.

Have fun!
